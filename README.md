- Super fast GoL live simulator
- Play/pause
- Trailing
- Colors
  - FG/BG
  - Just created?
  - Just died?
- Embiggen pixels to 2x2, 4x4, etc

Use webgl shader
Maybe use the default option setter thingy?

Here's what we'll have for sure, bare minimum:
  BUTTON: Play/pause
  BUTTON: Reset
  BUTTON: Fullscreen
  COLOR_PICKER: FG
  COLOR_PICKER: BG
  RANGE: Size (1px, 2, 3, etc)
  live cells:
    dRANGE: MIN/MAX NEIGHBORS
  dead cells:
    dRANGE: MIN/MAX NEIGHBORS
  DROPDOWN: Presets? // maybe
